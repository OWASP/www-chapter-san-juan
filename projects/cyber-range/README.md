## Welcome to the OWASP San Juan Chapter Cyber Range Community Project

This is a Community driven project, to facilitate the infrastructure to host [Capture-the-flag]() envents, provide cyber operations training, and also as a space to interact with other community members and partners in solving challenges and fixing vulnerabilities. The goal of this project is to provide a free, open source, and community driven cyber range for the San Juan community.
